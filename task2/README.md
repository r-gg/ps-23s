# Task 2

## Description

An interpreter for a simple functional programming language.

### Three modes of operation

1. Creation mode (Builds functions and saves them to the function registry)
2. Application mode (Sets the bounded variables inside built structures ~ functions)
3. Evaluation mode (Evaluates functions **where possible** ~ if all arguments are evaluated to an integer)

## Usage

```bash
$ python3 main.py <filename>
```

## Setup

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
